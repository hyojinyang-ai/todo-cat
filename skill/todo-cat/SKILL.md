name: todo-cat
description: Install, deploy, maintain and extend the todo-cat macOS app — a floating To-Do panel (pyobjc + WKWebView) with a walking cat pet, Outlook calendar import, Pomodoro, and Obsidian dashboard/retro automation. Use this skill whenever the user mentions todo-cat, the To-Do panel app, the cat pet, "~/.claude-todo", panel.py / panel.html / todo.py, Daily Log / Dashboard / retro files in the Obsidian Tracker folder, or asks to fix, change, add a feature to, redeploy, or reinstall their to-do app — even if they just say "the app" or "the cat". Also use it for any macOS pyobjc floating-window, TCC/calendar-permission, LaunchAgent, or Dock/app-bundle question that resembles this project.

# todo-cat

Open-source personal productivity app (GitHub `hyojinyang-ai/todo-cat`), usually cloned to `~/.claude-todo`. Reply in the user's language, concisely; offer options when a request is ambiguous.

## Product rules (decided by the user — do not "improve" them away)
1. **On the Pomodoro page, the cat sits with the singing bowl** (`assets/pomo_zen.png`, gently swaying with floating notes) — never the walk cycle. This applies to the Pomodoro page only: the desktop cats on the panel are independent of the timer and keep doing whatever they were doing (sit, walk after interaction, loaf).
2. The pet sits idle on the panel and walks only for 60 s after a to-do interaction (add/complete/edit/click/typing). Pomodoro ticks and calendar refreshes are not activity. After `loaf_after` (config, default 5 min) without panel use, cats that have loaf frames settle into a loaf and get up on the next interaction — idle cats never start walking on their own.
3. Obsidian output (Daily Log, Dashboard, retro) is bilingual ko/en; the UI follows the language setting.

## What it is (30 seconds)
- **Floating panel** (`app/panel.py` + `app/panel.html`): normal window level by default (*Always on top* is a setting), all Spaces, non-activating; cat windows are its child windows. Pages: Todo / Pomodoro / Settings (ko·en).
- **Data core** (`app/todo.py`): tasks in `<vault>/Tracker/tasks.json` (vault from `config.json`); writes Obsidian **Daily Log / Monthly / Dashboard / Retros**.
- **Automation** (scheduler thread in `app/panel.py`): 08:00 Outlook events → Meeting todos; 18:00 bilingual AI retro + log/dashboard refresh; midnight rollover; 15-min calendar refresh.
- **Cat pets**: one transparent window per chosen cat (Settings → Cats) above the panel; sits when idle, walks 60 s after any interaction, loafs after `loaf_after`; expressions on add/done. Cats are auto-discovered from `assets/pets/<cat>/` (only `sprout/` ships; other folders are git-ignored cat packs).
- **App identity**: `~/Applications/To-Do.app` (bundle id `com.todocat.app`), LaunchAgent `com.todocat.panel`, menu bar item, Dock icon.

Read `references/architecture.md` before editing code. Read `references/pitfalls.md` before touching images, permissions, or the app bundle — every item there cost real debugging time.

## Fresh install (new Mac)
```bash
git clone https://github.com/hyojinyang-ai/todo-cat ~/.claude-todo && ~/.claude-todo/install/setup.sh
```
`setup.sh` detects Obsidian vaults and writes `config.json`. Then: System Settings → Internet Accounts → add your calendar account (calendar on) → click **[일정 소스 다시 확인]** in the panel → allow calendar access. Optionally drag `To-Do.app` to the Dock.

## Change → deploy (every time)
1. Edit with a Python patch script: `s.replace(old, new, 1)` guarded by `assert old in s`. Never rely on silent no-ops.
2. `python3 -m py_compile ~/.claude-todo/app/panel.py ~/.claude-todo/app/todo.py`
3. Restart with `scripts/deploy.sh` (kills **all** instances, clears the pid file, kickstarts via launchd). `launchctl kickstart -k` alone is not enough.
4. Verify: `pgrep -f panel.py`, `tail /tmp/claude-panel.log`. After touching the bridge or Pomodoro code run `python3 tests/smoke_pomodoro_end.py` (real WebKit → pyobjc round-trip; exit 0 = alive). For image work, render a check sheet on a checkerboard and look at it with `read_file` (downscale with `sips -Z 700` first).
5. `git add -A && git commit -m "<what/why>" && git push`. Keep `CHANGELOG.md` current for user-visible changes.

## Common requests → where to look
| Request | Touch |
|---|---|
| UI text, layout, new page/control | `app/panel.html` (`L` strings ko **and** en, `render()`, `post({action})`) |
| New action from UI | `app/panel.html` → `app/panel.py` `Bridge.userContentController_didReceiveScriptMessage_` |
| Categories | `app/todo.py` `CATS` (name → (color, Korean label)); everything else follows |
| Daily Log / Dashboard / Monthly format | `app/todo.py` `write_daily_log`, `write_dashboard`, `write_monthly_page`, `write_heatmap_svg` |
| Retro prompt / language | `app/todo.py` `retro()` (single call, ko then `---` then en; preserves user notes) |
| Schedules (08:00, 18:00, rollover) | `app/panel.py` `scheduler()`; markers `state/imported.json`, `state/eod.json` |
| Pet behaviour / speed / frames | `app/panel.py` `walker()`/`step_pet()`, `Pet.apply_image/set`, `discover_pets()`; frames via `tools/mkframes.py`, `tools/mksit.py` → `assets/pets/<cat>/` |
| Calendar source | `app/panel.py` `do_fetch` (ICS → EventKit → Graph) |
| Sound / images | `assets/` (pets/<cat>/, pomo_zen.png, singing-bowl.mp3); originals stay in `~/Downloads` |

## Images: the only safe workflow
Ask the user to place source images in `~/Downloads` and give you the path — never move pixels through chat (base64 broke alpha twice). Process on the Mac with `NSBitmapImageRep` + `setColor_atX_y_` (see `tools/mksit.py`, `tools/mkframes.py`), keep **RGBA PNG**, verify visually. Details in `references/pitfalls.md`.

## Cost awareness
Running the app costs 0 tokens. One retro ≈ $0.05–0.10 (`claude -p`). Development chats are the real cost — keep changes small and start a fresh conversation per change.
