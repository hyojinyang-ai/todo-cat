# todo-cat — project instructions

## What this is
A stress-free To-Do app for macOS: always-on-top floating panel + Outlook events imported at 08:00 as Meeting tasks
+ Pomodoro + Obsidian Daily Log / Monthly / Dashboard / AI retro + a cat pet walking along the panel. Python (pyobjc) + WKWebView.
Reply in the user's language, concisely. When a request has several readings, offer options.

## Product rules (decided by the user — do not "improve" them away)
1. **On the Pomodoro page, the cat sits with the singing bowl** (`assets/pomo_zen.png`, gently swaying with floating notes) — never the walk cycle. This applies to the Pomodoro page only: the desktop cats on the panel are independent of the timer and keep doing whatever they were doing (sit, walk after interaction, loaf).
2. The pet sits idle on the panel and walks only for 60 s after a to-do interaction (add/complete/edit/click/typing). Pomodoro ticks and calendar refreshes are not activity. After `loaf_after` (config, default 5 min) without panel use, cats that have loaf frames settle into a loaf and get up on the next interaction — idle cats never start walking on their own.
3. Obsidian output (Daily Log, Dashboard, retro) is bilingual ko/en; the UI follows the language setting.

## Locations
- Code: `~/.Codex-todo/` (clone of GitHub `hyojinyang-ai/todo-cat`)
- App bundle: `~/Applications/To-Do.app` (`To-Do` = zsh wrapper → `To-Do-bin` = copy of the Python GUI binary; bundle id `com.todocat.app`)
- Login item: `~/Library/LaunchAgents/com.todocat.panel.plist`
- Config: `config.json` at repo root (vault_path, vault_name, lang, import_hour, eod_hour, claude_bin) — created by `install/setup.sh`, git-ignored
- Data (not in repo): `<vault>/Tracker/tasks.json`, `Tracker/{Log,Monthly,Retros}/`, `Dashboard.md`; settings/caches `~/.Codex-todo/state/`
- Source images live in `~/Downloads`; ask for the path and process on the Mac. Never move pixels through chat (base64 corrupted files twice, wastes tokens).

## Files (repo layout: `app/` code · `assets/pets/<cat>/` images (one folder per cat, auto-discovered; only `sprout/` is tracked) · `tools/` generators · `install/` bundle + setup · `state/` runtime, ignored)
- `app/panel.py` app: `Bridge` (JS↔Python actions), panel + pet windows, status item, main menu, `walker()` (pet), `scheduler()` (midnight rollover · 08:00 import · 18:00 end-of-day · 15-min calendar refresh)
- `app/panel.html` single-file UI (asset URLs are `../assets/...`): three pages (todo / pomodoro / settings), `L` object for ko·en i18n, `post({action})` → Python, `render(state)` ← Python
- `app/todo.py` data core + `write_daily_log` / `write_monthly_page` / `write_dashboard` / `write_heatmap_svg` + `retro()` (`Codex -p`, bilingual) + `run_eod()` + `dashboard()`. Categories in `CATS` (name → (color, Korean label)); vault/schedule from `CFG`
- `tools/mkframes.py` sprite sheet → 16 walk frames · `tools/mksit.py` sitting cat + expressions · `install/setup.sh` reinstall

## Change → deploy (always this order)
```
python3 -m py_compile ~/.Codex-todo/app/panel.py ~/.Codex-todo/app/todo.py
pkill -f panel.py; sleep 1; rm -f ~/.Codex-todo/state/panel.pid
launchctl kickstart gui/$(id -u)/com.todocat.panel
```
(or `skill/todo-cat/scripts/deploy.sh`)
- `kickstart -k` alone is not enough: the single-instance guard yields to a surviving old process and the new code never appears. Always pkill + remove the pid file.
- After `codesign`, the calendar permission prompt may appear again — tell the user.
- Finish with `git add -A && git commit -m "..." && git push` (English message, what/why in one line) and update `CHANGELOG.md` for user-visible changes.

## Patch rules
- Edit files from a Python script with `s.replace(old, new, 1)` and `assert old in s` on every anchor (silent no-ops have bitten several times).
- Adding `L` strings: add to **both** ko and en, anchored on the real last key of each object.
- pyobjc: NSObject subclass methods carry one trailing `_` per argument (`runjs_`); helpers go outside the class or use `objc.python_method`.

## Known pitfalls
- **RGBA PNG only.** Palette (P) PNGs lose their alpha on macOS. To shrink, quantize RGB and re-attach the original alpha.
- **No SVG via NSImage** — fills are ignored, you get a silhouette. Draw with NSBezierPath or use PNG.
- macOS 14+ calendar permission needs a usage description in Info.plist **and** the request must come from the launchd-run bundle (TCC "responsible process"). Requests from a terminal or Codex-spawned process are silently denied.
- `exec` into a binary outside the bundle strips the app identity → keep the binary copy inside the bundle. The Dock launches the executable with no arguments → the executable must be a wrapper.
- Verify images by pixels: composite on a checkerboard, `sips -Z 700`, then `read_file`.
- Dock/menu bar need `NSApplicationActivationPolicyRegular`; the panel is a NonactivatingPanel, so clicking it does not switch the menu bar (activate via the Dock icon).
- Pet window at `NSFloatingWindowLevel + 1` so its feet are not covered; position relative to the panel and clamp to that screen's visible frame.

## Cost awareness
Running the app: 0 tokens. One AI retro ≈ $0.05–0.10. Development chats are the whole cost → small changes in short fresh conversations.
